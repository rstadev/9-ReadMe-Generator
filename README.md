  ## Description
  This was a project assigned during the Ga Tech Full Stack Flex Development program. The aim of this project was to utilize node to create a script capable of creating a professional ReadMe quickly and easily, as creating professionally formatted Read Me's can be both consuming and difficult. This app takes in user input and provides a ready to use tempelate that a user can add onto or utilize directly in their project.

  ## Usage
  To use this program, type in node index.js, and the script should launch. Then type in your responses to the generated prompts, and a markdown file  will be generated in the develop folder entitled "GeneratedReadMe". This page should have all of the information you provided previously in a professional format. From here you can either add onto this tempelate or use it directly in your project.
