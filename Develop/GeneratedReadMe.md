  ## Description
  This project was assigned during the Georgia Tech Full Stack Flex Development Program. The aim of this project was to utilize sequelize to create a javascript based backend system capable of housing data needed for a shopping website or app. This system would be entirely independent from a front end, which gives it versatility in developing its front end component. As of now everything assigned works, and a developer can put, post, get, or delete data using postman or insomnia.

  ## Usage
  To use this app, download this file on github. Create a .env file and fill it with your user information. Run the 'create database' command located in the schema file in the db folder. Then run npmm start, npm seed, then npm start again. This syncs the table structure, creates the data, then starts the server. From here you should be able to use postman and insomnia to handle data manipulation.
